    				<h2>Insight into b'ing Creative</h2>
					<p>Iâ€™ve made my home base in sunny Florida, with my dreams in toe. My journey into tech started with writing my first requirements document. As I started writing and documenting business processes, I was fascinated with how easily I could help to automate manual processes and create more efficient users. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build web applications and help business units excel. That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut.</p>

                    <h2>So let's create a masterpiece</h2>
					<p>Offering creative design solutions to solve business problems is what I do best. I code in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. I also integrate with databases and make engaging user experiences. I like working on bringing your brand and vision to life through the latest technology and design principles. As a designer and a developer, I write code that conforms to industry standards and semantic best practices. I am able to transform static artwork into pixel prefect, interactive and fully functional interfaces.</p>
