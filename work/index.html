                            <p>In defining my own brand and corporate values, I came across Holstee, a company dedicated to being mindful of one’s life and what’s important in living it. With this in mind, I felt it fitting to take their manifesto and produce a version that was a bit brighter and fit more of my personality and who I am.</p>

        					<p>In partnering with the client, we set out to understand her end goals, objectives for her brand, her desires, passions, and ultimately what drives her as a developer. Within hours, we were able to define her brand, layout the site framework, and choose just the right images to showcase her work. After a few weeks of collaboration, I was able to bring her site online.</p>

                            <p>The client is a new mobile fresh food truck in my area. They were looking to take their mobile business online so that their consumers could quickly and easily contact them or find their next location. I worked with them to produce brand that created a sense of freshness when the user viewed their website which showcased their fresh products.</p>
